# TCS_CodeVita_Season_12

This repository contains my solutions for the TCS CodeVita Season 12 programming competition, including various MockVita problems.

## MockVita Problems

1. **VIP Cafe**
   - **Description:** Raj runs a busy cafe frequented by VIPs who order costly beverages. To ensure VIPs are served quickly while also keeping other customers satisfied, Raj introduces a dynamic priority system for orders. When an order is served, the priority of the remaining orders is adjusted, favoring VIPs while balancing the service for others. Given the current queue, calculate how many orders will be served before Raj's friend's order is processed.

2. **Best Bubble**
   - **Description:** The goal is to determine the minimum number of swaps required to sort an array in either ascending or descending order. A "beautiful" array is defined as one that is completely sorted in one of these two ways. Implement a solution to find the minimum swaps necessary to achieve this state.

3. **Zero Count**
   - **Description:** Ashok and Anand argue about the number of fruits from selected rows of lemon (L) and mango (M) trees. They need to choose three trees such that no two adjacent trees are of the same type. The challenge is to determine which row has more valid selections based on the provided string representation of the trees. If the input is invalid, return "Invalid input"; if both have equal selections, return "Draw".

4. **Weapon Boxes**
   - **Description:** In a military camp, boxes of weapons arrive with different weights, indicating the quantity of weapons inside. The commander wants to prioritize boxes with higher weights and will cycle through the first N boxes, comparing and shifting the lighter box to the end. This continues until one box remains unchanged for K consecutive cycles. Calculate the cost of labor based on the sum of weights of boxes, excluding those with triangular numbers as weights.

5. **Orchard**
   - **Description:** This problem involves determining the winner between two friends who have selected rows of trees represented by strings of 'M' and 'L'. Each friend can select three non-adjacent trees, and the challenge is to find out who has the maximum valid selections. The solution needs to validate the input string and determine the winner based on the valid selections.
